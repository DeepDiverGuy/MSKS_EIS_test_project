- JQuery, because:
    - Struggled for 2 days for hardware issues & another 2 days just to solve a stupid Microsoft Visual Studio Installation problem (.NET Sdk PATH). Totally on Microsoft.
    - Didn't have prior knowledge. Takes time to figure out.
    - So, I didn't get enough time. I did all the coding in 1 night only.
    - I believe, if given more time, I could do it.
